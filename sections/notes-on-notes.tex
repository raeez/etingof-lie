\subsection{Notes on the notes}

Chapters 1 and 2 of these notes are the most complete, due to Darij Grinberg.
Chapters 3 and 4 are a mess, and are to an even greater extent potentially
incorrect and almost certainly unusable;

Raeez Lorgat has a prelimanry rewrite on chapters 3 and 4; should you wish be
willing to proofread these, email him at \texttt{\url{root at raeez
dot com}}.

It is suggested that the reader at hand a copy of Pasha Etingof's
hand-written notes \newline\texttt{\url{http://www-math.mit.edu/~etingof/}}
The following index into Pasha's notes may help (or harm):

\nc\Vir{\mbf{Vir}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Course introduction, Virasoro Algebra.
  \item Dixmier's Lemma, Fock Spaces,
    Triangular Decomposition and the first remarks on duality.
  \item Genericity, Simple Quotient,
    Characters, Grading, Definition of Highest-Weight modules.
  \item Fundamental concepts for the examples of $\sl_2$, $\Vir$
\end{enumerate}<++>
