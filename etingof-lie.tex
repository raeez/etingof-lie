% NOTE ON THE DETAILED AND SHORT VERSIONS:
% -------------------------------------------------------------
% This paper comes in two versions, a detailed and a short one.
% The short version should be more than sufficient for any
% reasonable use; the detailed one was written purely to
% convince the author of its correctness.
% To switch between the two versions, find the line containing
% "\newenvironment{noncompile}{}{}" in this LaTeX file.
% Look at the two lines right beneath this line.
% To compile the detailed version, they should be as follows:
%   \includecomment{verlong}
%   \excludecomment{vershort}
% To compile the short version, they should be as follows:
%   \excludecomment{verlong}
%   \includecomment{vershort}
% As a rule, the line
%   \excludecomment{noncompile}
% should stay as it is.

% NOTES ON SOME HACKS USED IN THIS FILE:
% -------------------------------------------------------------
% One of my pet peeves with amsthm is its use of italics in the theorem and
% proposition environments; this makes math and text indistinguishable in said
% enviroments. To avoid this, I redefine the enviroments to use the standard
% font and to use a hanging indent, along with a bold vertical bar to its
% left, to distinguish these environments from surrounding text. (Along with
% the advantage of distinguishing math from text, this also allows nesting
% several such environments inside each other, like a definition inside a
% remark. I'm not sure how good of an idea this is, though. There are also
% downsides related to the hanging indentation, such as footnotes out of it
% being painful to do right.) This is done starting from the line
%   \theoremstyle{definition}
% and until the line
%   {\end{leftbar}\end{exmp}}
